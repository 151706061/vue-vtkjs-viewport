# vue-vtkjs-viewport
VTK.js image viewport component for Vue, with the goal of providing a MultiPlaner Reconstruction implementation, with arbitrary slice angles, better than VTK.js's default options.

See the Examples running https://vue-vtkjs-viewport.netlify.app/

Sister project of [react-vtkjs-viewport](https://github.com/OHIF/react-vtkjs-viewport), with some variations of implementation.

=======

NOTE: This project has not received much love, and is now quite diverged from the react-vtkjs-viewport project. Happy to accept PRs to update it!
