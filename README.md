# vue-vtkjs-viewport

VTK.js image viewport component for Vue, with the goal of providing a MultiPlaner Reconstruction implementation, with arbitrary slice angles, better than VTK.js's default options.

Sister project of [react-vtkjs-viewport](https://github.com/OHIF/react-vtkjs-viewport), with some variations of implementation.
